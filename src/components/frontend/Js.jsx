Memory Creation Phase:
- Variables declared with \`var\` are hoisted and initialized with \`undefined\`.
- Function declarations are hoisted with their entire definitions.
- Variables declared with \`let\` and \`const\` are hoisted but remain uninitialized (in the Temporal Dead Zone).

Code Execution Phase:
- Code is executed line by line.
- Variables receive their actual assigned values.
- Function calls create new Function Execution Contexts that are pushed onto the call stack.

  title: "This keyword",
  description: `The \`this\` keyword behaves differently based on where and how a function is invoked.

In the Global Execution Context (GEC), \`this\` refers to the global object (e.g., \`window\` in browsers), regardless of strict or non-strict mode.

In Function Execution Context:
- Non-strict mode: \`this\` still points to the global object.
- Strict mode: \`this\` becomes \`undefined\`.`,

  tips: [
    `Inside Object Methods:
When a function is called as a method of an object, \`this\` refers to that object, regardless of where it's declared.`,

    `Arrow Functions:
Arrow functions do not have their own \`this\`. They inherit \`this\` from the surrounding lexical scope.`,

\`this\` in the GEC refers to the global object, but in strict mode inside a function, it becomes \`undefined\`.`

  title: "Hoisting",
  description: `Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope during the Memory Creation Phase in the Global Execution Context (GEC).

Variables declared with \`var\` are hoisted and initialized as \`undefined\`, while \`let\` and \`const\` are hoisted but left uninitialized (Temporal Dead Zone).

Function declarations are fully hoisted with their definitions, making them callable before they're defined.`,

  title: "Temporal Dead Zone",
  description: `The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is the period between the hoisting of a \`let\`, \`const\`, or \`class\` declaration and its initialization.

Although these variables are hoisted during the Memory Creation Phase of the Global Execution Context (GEC), they remain uninitialized until execution reaches the line where they're defined.

Accessing them during this zone results in a \`ReferenceError\`.`,

- \`map()\`: Transforms each element in the array and returns a new array of the same length.
